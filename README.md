# Escape the 80s

Escape the 80s is a web-based side-scrolling game with both campaign and multiplayer modes. The (soldier) players must fight their way back from the 80s if they don't wish to be forever trapped in a world of fanny packs, leg warmers, and neon fashion!

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repo.
2. npm install.
3. Create escape-the-80s database.
4. Start the build process and your application with: npm run start-dev. If you're using Windows, you may need to execute npm run start-server and npm run build-watch separately (in their own terminal tabs).
5. Navigate to localhost:8080 to see the site in the browser.
6. Check out the starting seed file in seed.js - you can run it by executing npm run seed. You will need to seed the database once you've set up the Sequelize models.
